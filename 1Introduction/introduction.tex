\section{Introduction}
LabXplorer revolutionizes science education by providing an innovative virtual laboratory platform designed to transcend traditional learning methods. Tailored specifically for students and educators in STEM fields, LabXplorer aims to bridge gaps in practical science education by offering interactive simulations and experiments across diverse disciplines. This cutting-edge platform serves as a dedicated arena where learners can engage deeply with scientific concepts, conduct virtual experiments, visualize data, and collaborate seamlessly within their academic community.


\section{Problem Statement}
LabXplorer addresses critical gaps in science education by providing a dedicated platform specifically designed for virtual laboratory experiences. Unlike general educational platforms that lack interactive laboratory components, LabXplorer offers tailored modules such as Basic Electronics Lab, Basic Chemistry Lab, Basic Astronomy Simulations, and a Basic Online Coding Environment with animations. This specialized approach enables students to gain hands-on experience and apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings, enhancing their understanding and retention of scientific concepts. For educators, LabXplorer provides tools to perform simulations, create experiment workflows, assign tasks to students, and facilitate collaborative learning through a discussion forum. By integrating various scientific disciplines into a unified virtual laboratory environment, LabXplorer streamlines the learning process and supports deeper engagement with subject matter. This platform is particularly valuable for schools and institutions with limited physical laboratory resources, ensuring all students have access to high-quality educational experiences regardless of their location or infrastructure constraints.
\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a virtual laboratory platform that enhances science education through interactive simulations and experiments across various disciplines.
\end{itemize}
\section{Scope}
% Scope and limitation

\begin{itemize}
