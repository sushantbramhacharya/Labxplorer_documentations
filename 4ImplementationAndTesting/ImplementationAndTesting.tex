\section{Tools Used}
\textbf{Figma}\\
Figma is a cloud-based design and prototyping tool that empowers teams to collaborate on UI/UX design projects in real-time. It offers a user-friendly interface and powerful features that make it a popular choice among designers. With Figma, designers can create and share interactive prototypes, design components, and design systems. Its cloud-based nature allows for seamless collaboration, enabling multiple team members to work on the same design simultaneously. Figma supports version control, ensuring that design iterations can be easily tracked and managed. \\
\textbf{React}\\
React is a widely-used open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes frequently. It emphasizes a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components that encapsulate their own structure, logic, and styling. Reactâ€™s use of a virtual DOM enhances performance by minimizing direct updates to the real DOM, ensuring efficient rendering. With its declarative approach, developers specify what the UI should look like based on different states, making the code more predictable and easier to debug. Additionally, React introduces JSX, a syntax extension that combines JavaScript and HTML, making it straightforward to write and understand UI components.\\
\textbf{Postgres}\\
PostgreSQL, often referred to simply as Postgres, is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its reliability, robustness, and extensibility. Developed over decades and maintained by a global community of contributors, PostgreSQL offers a comprehensive set of features for managing structured data. It supports complex queries, transactions with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and a wide range of data types including JSON, XML, and spatial data. PostgreSQL's commitment to standards compliance and continuous improvement ensures compatibility with various programming languages and frameworks. With capabilities for scalability, data integrity, and advanced indexing, PostgreSQL is a preferred choice for applications requiring robust data management and high availability, contributing to its widespread adoption across industries from small startups to large enterprises. \\
\textbf{Git/Github}\\
Git is a distributed version control system that is both free and open-source, designed to handle projects of all sizes efficiently and swiftly. It simplifies collaboration by enabling multiple individuals to contribute changes that can be seamlessly merged into a single source. When using Git, the software runs locally on your computer, storing your files and their complete history. Alternatively, you can utilize online hosts like GitHub to store a copy of your files and their revision history. This central repository allows you to easily upload your changes and download updates from other developers, promoting seamless collaboration. Git facilitates automatic merging of changes, allowing multiple individuals to work on different sections of the same file and later merge their modifications without losing any work.\\
\textbf{Node Js with Express}\\
Node.js with Express.js is a powerful combination for building scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js provides a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed server-side, leveraging its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. Express.js, as a minimalist web framework for Node.js, simplifies the creation of APIs and routes, offering robust features such as middleware support, routing, and template engines. Together, Node.js and Express.js enable rapid development of RESTful APIs and web servers, making them well-suited for creating real-time applications, microservices, and backend systems. With a vibrant ecosystem of libraries and active community support, Node.js with Express.js remains a popular choice for developers seeking flexibility, performance, and scalability in web application development.\\
\textbf{JavaScript}\\
JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages and backend server. It is a powerful and versatile language that can be used to do a wide variety of things, including adding animation and interactivity to web pages, validating form data, processing user input, making Ajax requests to the server, and creating games and other interactive applications.\\
\textbf{Phaser}\\
Phaser is a powerful and popular open-source HTML5 game framework designed for creating 2D games that can run in both web browsers and mobile environments. Developed by Photon Storm, Phaser is known for its versatility and ease of use, making it a favorite among both beginner and experienced game developers. The framework supports Canvas and WebGL rendering, automatically selecting the best option based on the device's capabilities. Phaser offers a robust set of features including physics engines (Arcade Physics, P2 Physics, and Matter.js), input handling, asset management, animations, and audio integration. Its component-based architecture allows developers to build complex games by combining reusable pieces of code, enhancing modularity and maintainability. With an active community, extensive documentation, and numerous tutorials, Phaser provides ample resources for learning and development, empowering creators to bring their game ideas to life efficiently.
