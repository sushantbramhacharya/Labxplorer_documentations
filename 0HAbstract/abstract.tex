LabXplorerX is an innovative web application that will be developed using React, Express, and Postgres, designed to provide interactive learning community . This platform offers a user-friendly interface where students can conduct various simulation, read science related content, perform quizes, track their progress. By leveraging real-time, visually engaging simulations powered by Phaser.js and Unity 3D, LabXplorerX enhances students' understanding of scientific concepts through hands-on learning. The platform also supports collaboration and knowledge sharing via integrated discussions and quizes, fostering a community of inquisitive learners. Comprehensive feasibility studies, addressing technical, operational, and economic aspects, along with detailed system design diagrams, ensure the platform's robustness and scalability. Utilizing the latest web-platform development technologies, LabXplorerX delivers a responsive and efficient user experience. Rigorous unit testing, particularly on the authentication module, ensures security and reliability, making LabXplorerX a dynamic, effective, and engaging tool for modern science education.
