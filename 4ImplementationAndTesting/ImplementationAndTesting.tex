\subsection{Implementation Details of Modules}
This subsection outlines the implementation specifics for each module, detailing the core functionalities and algorithms utilized. It covers the programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in development, along with the interaction and communication between modules. Key design patterns, data management strategies, and error-handling mechanisms are discussed to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, security measures and optimizations applied during implementation are highlighted.

\textbf{Frontend API Integration Module}\newline
This diagram depicts the architecture of a web application where a React frontend communicates with an Express server through RTK Query and Axios. The process starts with the React frontend triggering either queries or mutations, which are handled by the Redux Toolkit (RTK) API slices. These slices manage API interactions, including the request and response lifecycle. Axios is used to send HTTP requests from the frontend to the Express server. The server processes incoming requests, performs necessary operations (such as database interactions), and sends responses back to Axios. Axios then passes the response data to RTK slices, which manage state updates. This architecture ensures smooth, organized data flow between the client and server, making it easier to handle API calls, manage state, and ensure a responsive user experience.

 \end{figure}
\textbf{User Registration Module}

This diagram outlines a registration or authentication process involving several components. The user interacts with a React frontend to register or request access. A Token Generator backend service creates an authentication token, which is sent to the user via email using Node Mailer (implemented with Node.js and Nodemailer). The user submits the token back to the system, and the Token Verification service checks its validity. The Postgres database stores user information and tokens, ensuring that the submitted token matches the one in the database for verification. This flow connects the frontend, backend, email system, and database for user authentication.

     \caption{Registration Module}
 \end{figure}
\textbf{Authentication Module}
\newline
The Authentication Module utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens that encode user information, including a signature to verify the token's integrity. After a successful login, a JWT is generated and stored in an HTTP-only cookie, preventing unauthorized access via client-side scripts. The module also includes bcrypt hashing for securely storing user credentials and authentication middleware that checks the validity of the JWT on each request, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected resources.
