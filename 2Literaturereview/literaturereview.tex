\section{Background Study}

We are looking for designs that make out system visually appealing and at the same time have better performance. As this system is mainly for creatives who can share their journey, we need to implement a profile system that shows off their portfolio and resume. Showcasing their skills should be easy so this system mainly focuses on functionalities implementations. We are looking for different tools and techniques for achieving those goals. We are also studying papers, articles, and related books for our project. We are also learning about implementation about messaging system.
The proposed project is to create an app for creative it professionals where they can share their discussions, projects, skills, and perform messaging functions. To develop this app, it is important to understand code collaboration, tools for code sharing, and messaging functions.
\section{Limitation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphics are planned to designed by myself can reduce in quality and become time consuming.
    \item We cannot message through our system directly.
\end{itemize}
\section{Literature Review}
Social networks are like groups of people who know each other and interact with each other. The technology helps us study how people are connected to each other and how they talk to each other online. It also helps us understand the things they say and the information they share.\cite{korshunov2014social}\\\\
In today's competitive job market, organizations strive to identify and attract top talent, and this research investigates the influence of social media on the recruitment process. With the rapid growth of social media usage, it is crucial for organizations to understand effective strategies for attracting the best candidates. The study involved 12 recruiters from various industries, and the findings reveal heavy reliance on platforms like LinkedIn for recruitment purposes. However, the use of Twitter and Facebook for recruitment is comparatively lower. Recruiters need a focused approach when utilizing social media to manage the potential overwhelming volume of work. It is evident that recruiters cannot effectively conduct recruitment activities without leveraging social media tools, but proper training in optimizing social media usage is essential. This study contributes to highlighting the significant impact of LinkedIn on recruitment processes, while also emphasizing that social media is not a one-size-fits-all solution for recruitment challenges.\cite{koch2018impact}\\\\
In Stack Overflow, A complete profile includes details such as a website URL, location, about me section, profile image, and age. Our analysis revealed that most users do not have a complete profile. However, users with complete profiles tend to have higher reputation scores and provide better quality question and answer posts compared to users with incomplete profiles. This suggests that having a complete profile is beneficial for contributing effectively to the network. Among the profile elements we examined, location and about me have a stronger relationship with user activity and contribution. This research helps us understand which profile elements are important in a Q and A social network and which ones should be prioritized for users to fill out regularly.\cite{adaji2016towards}\\\\
We examine the characteristics of developers involved in Open Source software creation to understand what factors contribute to innovation within the Open Source community. The analysis reveals that having a higher reputation within the community increases the likelihood of attracting collaborators, although developers are also motivated by reciprocity, aligning with the principles of a gift economy. Additionally, we find a significant network effect resulting from standardization, indicating that developers who use popular programming languages in their projects are more likely to collaborate with others. Furthermore, providing additional information, such as a valid URL to the developer's homepage, increases the chances of finding coworkers. These findings can be applied to the broader population of experienced users on platforms like GitHub.\cite{celinska2018coding}\\\\
GitHub has recently introduced a new feature called Discussions, which serves as a platform for developers to ask questions and engage in broader discussions that go beyond specific Issues. Before its widespread availability in December 2020, Discussions underwent testing on selected open source software projects. In order to gain insights into developers' utilization of this innovative feature, their perceptions of it, and its impact on the software development process, we conducted a comprehensive mixed-methods study involving early adopters of GitHub discussions between January and July 2020.Developers perceive GitHub Discussions as a valuable tool; however, they encounter challenges related to topic duplication between Discussions and Issues. This issue poses a concern, as it leads to confusion and redundancy in communication.\cite{hata2022github}
