\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
\section{System Development Approach}
An incremental approach, also known as an iterative or step-by-step approach, is a development or problem-solving method that breaks down a larger task or project into smaller, manageable increments or steps. Rather than attempting to tackle the entire task at once, an incremental approach focuses on making incremental progress by completing and delivering smaller portions of work in a series of iterations.

\section{Requirement Analysis}
\section{Feasibility Analysis}
A feasibility study is a systematic and structured analysis conducted to determine the viability and practicality of a proposed project plan. It serves as an evaluation tool to assess whether the project can be successfully implemented and if it aligns with the organization's goals and objectives. It involves gathering and analyzing relevant information to determine if the project is technically feasible, operationally feasible, economically feasible, and scheduling feasible.
\subsection{Economical Feasibility}
Since the proposed system has a web application, we will be using free and open-source software development tools such as Flutter, Express, Postgres SQL. We will only need some economy for server for hosting.
\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
LabXplorer emphasizes operational feasibility through its user-centric approach, focusing on intuitive design and ease of use. The system is crafted to be highly interactive, allowing users, including students and educators, to navigate effortlessly without requiring extensive mobile app expertise. The user interface (UI) is designed with a clean layout and intuitive controls, ensuring a seamless experience for exploring features such as virtual experiments and educational resources. By minimizing training requirements and reducing potential user resistance, LabXplorer aims to enhance user acceptance and engagement. Overall, its intuitive design facilitates efficient utilization of the app's functionalities, supporting educational activities and fostering a positive user experience 
\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
Combining Express.js with Flutter and PostgreSQL presents a technically feasible approach for developing a modern and scalable application. Express.js, built on Node.js, serves as a powerful backend framework ideal for creating RESTful APIs and managing server-side logic efficiently. PostgreSQL, known for its reliability and advanced features in data management, provides a robust foundation for storing and querying data securely. On the frontend, Flutter offers a unified framework for building responsive and visually appealing applications across multiple platforms using a single codebase. This combination leverages the strengths of each technology: Express.js for backend scalability and API development, PostgreSQL for robust data handling, and Flutter for seamless cross-platform UI development. Supported by active communities and extensive documentation, this stack ensures technical support, resources, and flexibility for deployment and maintenance, making it well-suited for delivering modern, interactive applications.
\section{HIGH LEVEL DESIGN OF SYSTEM}
\subsection{Architecture Design}
The following diagram shows diagram of our Architecture. Mainly shows what are the functions can be accessed after starting our application.

\subsection{Data Modelling(ER-Diagram)}
ER Diagram is mainly used to design database schema. With the help of below er diagram we can easily design database in SQL.

\subsection{Activity Diagram}
An activity diagram visually presents a series of actions or flow of control in a system similar to a flowchart or a data flow diagram. This diagram showed how our program flow goes on.

\subsection{DFD}
DFD or Data Flow Diagram is mainly used to show how data are being flowed in and out of our system. There are 3 levels of DFD i.e Context Level(Level 0),Level 1 and Level 2

% \subsection{Use Case Diagram}
% A use case diagram, part of UML, visually represents interactions between actors and a system. Actors are external entities, while use cases depict specific functionalities. Relationships, such as association, generalization, include, and extend, illustrate connections between actors and use cases. The diagram helps in understanding system behavior, requirements, and scope.
