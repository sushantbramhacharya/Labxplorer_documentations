\section{Work Remaining}
As the LabXplorerX project progresses, several key tasks remain to be completed. The development team will focus on creating additional simulations to further expand the interactive learning opportunities available to students. The implementation of user profiles is also pending, which will enable students to personalize their learning experience, track progress, and manage their accounts. Additionally, a discussion forum needs to be integrated into the platform, allowing students and teachers to engage in meaningful conversations, share ideas, and collaborate on learning activities.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm]
    \item \textbf{More Simulations:} Continue creating additional simulations to broaden the range of interactive learning experiences available to students.
    
    \item \textbf{User Profiles:} Implement personalized user profiles, enabling students to track their progress, manage their accounts, and enhance their learning experience.
    
    \item \textbf{Discussion Forum:} Develop and integrate a discussion forum, facilitating communication and collaboration between students and teachers within the platform.
