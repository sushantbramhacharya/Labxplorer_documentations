\subsection{Implementation Details of Modules}
This subsection outlines the implementation specifics for each module, detailing the core functionalities and algorithms utilized. It covers the programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in development, along with the interaction and communication between modules. Key design patterns, data management strategies, and error-handling mechanisms are discussed to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, security measures and optimizations applied during implementation are highlighted.
\newline
\newpage
\textbf{Module of AtomSimulator}

The AtomSimulator module initializes the `selectedElement` with the first element from the `elements` array and sets up a Phaser game instance with appropriate dimensions and physics. It visualizes the atom by creating the nucleus and electron orbits, updates electron positions based on time, and handles user interactions to update the element and re-render the scene. The Phaser instance is destroyed upon component unmounting to free resources.
\newline
\textbf{Module of CodeEditor}

The CodeEditor module initializes states for `code` and `consoleOutput`. It creates an iframe to execute user-provided JavaScript code and captures console messages and errors. The `consoleOutput` is updated with iframe messages, and the iframe is removed from the DOM after execution to prevent resource leaks.
\newline
\textbf{Module of OhmsLawSimulator}

The OhmsLawSimulator module sets default values for voltage and resistance, initializes a Phaser game instance, and creates game elements. It continuously updates the bulb brightness based on the current \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), adjusts displayed values, and re-renders the simulation with user input changes. The Phaser instance is destroyed on component unmount.
\newline
\textbf{Module of GravitySim}

The GravitySim module sets up a Phaser game environment with gravity simulation. It creates game elements, displays initial values, and updates gravity, distance, and time during the simulation. Users can adjust gravity, reset the player, and pause or resume the simulation. The Phaser instance is destroyed on component unmount. The distance traveled is calculated using \( d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \).
\newline
\textbf{Module of SolarSystemSimulator}

The SolarSystemSimulator module initializes celestial bodies and the main camera. It attaches a `RotateAround` script to simulate planetary and moon orbits and a `FollowAtTarget` script to keep the camera focused on the selected object. Users can change the camera target, and the implementation involves creating bodies, configuring camera controls, and testing interactions.
\newpage
\textbf{Frontend API Integration Module}\newline
This diagram depicts the architecture of a web application where a React frontend communicates with an Express server through RTK Query and Axios. The process starts with the React frontend triggering either queries or mutations, which are handled by the Redux Toolkit (RTK) API slices. These slices manage API interactions, including the request and response lifecycle. Axios is used to send HTTP requests from the frontend to the Express server. The server processes incoming requests, performs necessary operations (such as database interactions), and sends responses back to Axios. Axios then passes the response data to RTK slices, which manage state updates. This architecture ensures smooth, organized data flow between the client and server, making it easier to handle API calls, manage state, and ensure a responsive user experience.

     \caption{API Integration Module}
 \end{figure}
\textbf{User Registration Module}

This diagram outlines a registration or authentication process involving several components. The user interacts with a React frontend to register or request access. A Token Generator backend service creates an authentication token, which is sent to the user via email using Node Mailer (implemented with Node.js and Nodemailer). The user submits the token back to the system, and the Token Verification service checks its validity. The Postgres database stores user information and tokens, ensuring that the submitted token matches the one in the database for verification. This flow connects the frontend, backend, email system, and database for user authentication.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
     \includegraphics[height = 5cm]{Diagrams/register_module.png}
     \caption{Registration Module}
 \end{figure}
\textbf{Authentication Module}
\newline
The Authentication Module utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens that encode user information, including a signature to verify the token's integrity. After a successful login, a JWT is generated and stored in an HTTP-only cookie, preventing unauthorized access via client-side scripts. The module also includes bcrypt hashing for securely storing user credentials and authentication middleware that checks the validity of the JWT on each request, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected resources.
